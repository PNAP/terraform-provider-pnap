# phoenixNAP Provider

The phoenixNAP provider is used to interact with the resources supported by PNAP.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the resources available.

Be cautious when using the `pnap_server` resource. By default, phoenixNAP invoices hourly per server.

# Authentication

The following authentication methods are supported:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables
- Configuration file

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `client_id` and `client_secret`
in-line in the pnap provider block:

Usage:

```terraform
provider "pnap" {
  client_id = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
}
```
You can provide your credentials via the `PNAP_CLIENT_ID` and
`PNAP_CLIENT_SECRET`, environment variables. Note that setting your
phoenixNAP credentials in provider block or environment variables
will override the use of `config_file_path` and configuration file for authentication.

You can use config.yaml file to specify your credentials.
The default location is in the user's home directory. File path on Linux is /.pnap/config.yaml and file path on Windows is \AppData\Roaming\pnap\config.yaml. You can optionally specify a different location in the Terraform configuration by providing the `config_file_path` argument.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "pnap" {
  config_file_path = ""C:\\config_test\\""
}
```

The following shows a sample config file:

			# ===================================================== 
			#Sample yaml config file 
			# =====================================================
			# Authentication
			clientId: <enter your client id>
			clientSecret: <enter your client secret>


## Example Usage

```hcl

# Create a server
resource "pnap_server" "Test-Server-1" {
    hostname = "Test-Server-1"
    os = "ubuntu/bionic"
    type = "s1.c1.medium"
    location = "PHX"
    ssh_keys = [
        "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDF9LdAFElNCi7JoWh6KUcchrJ2Gac1aqGRPpdZNowObpRtmiRCecAMb7bUgNAaNfcmwiQi7tos9TlnFgprIcfMWb8MSs3ABYHmBgqEEt3RWYf0fAc9CsIpJdMCUG28TPGTlRXCEUVNKgLMdcseAlJoGp1CgbHWIN65fB3he3kAZcfpPn5mapV0tsl2p+ZyuAGRYdn5dJv2RZDHUZBkOeUobwsij+weHCKAFmKQKtCP7ybgVHaQjAPrj8MGnk1jBbjDt5ws+Be+9JNjQJee9zCKbAOsIo3i+GcUIkrw5jxPU/RTGlWBcemPaKHdciSzGcjWboapzIy49qypQhZe1U75 user2@122.16.1.126"
