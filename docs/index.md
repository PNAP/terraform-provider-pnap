# PhoenixNAP Provider

The PhoenixNAP provider is used to interact with the resources supported by PNAP.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the resources available.

Be cautious when using the `pnap_server` resource. PhoenixNAP invoices hourly per server.

# Authentication

The config.yaml configuration file is required for authentication. The file should be located in the user's home directory. File path on Linux is /.pnap/config.yaml and file path on Windows is \AppData\Roaming\pnap\config.yaml

The following shows a sample config file:

			# =====================================================
